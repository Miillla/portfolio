        I am a tech enthusiast who for the last year has been learning and
        developing personal projects using React JS and AWS Amplify. I enjoy
        spending my free-time learning new skills in tech, staying up-to-date,
        discovering new tools and technologies. I'm interested and open to jobs
        or internships.
